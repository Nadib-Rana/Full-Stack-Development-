### Callbacks in JavaScript

#### **What is a Callback?**
A **callback** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. It’s a technique used to execute code once a certain task is completed. This is especially useful for asynchronous operations, like loading data, where you want to wait until a task is finished before continuing.

#### **How Do Callbacks Work?**
1. **Define the Main Function with a Callback Parameter**:
   - The main function takes another function (the callback) as a parameter, specifying that it will be used after the main function completes its main task.
   
2. **Pass a Function as an Argument**:
   - When you call the main function, you pass another function as an argument, which acts as the callback. This function won’t run immediately; it will wait until the main function completes.

3. **Execute the Callback After Completion**:
   - The main function runs its code and, at the designated point, calls the callback function, allowing you to continue with further actions once the initial task is complete.

#### **Where Are Callbacks Used?**
Callbacks are commonly used in:
   - **Asynchronous Operations**: Like fetching data from an API, reading files, or setting timers.
   - **Event Handling**: Responding to user interactions, like clicks or form submissions.
   - **Functional Programming**: Using functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` that take callback functions.

#### **Example of a Callback Function**

Here’s an example of using a callback with asynchronous data fetching:

```javascript
// Step 1: Define the main function with a callback parameter
function fetchData(callback) {
  console.log("Fetching data...");

  // Simulate a 2-second delay to mimic asynchronous behavior
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Data fetched successfully");

    // Step 3: Execute the callback after completing the main task
    callback();
  }, 2000);
}

// Step 2: Define the callback function to process the fetched data
function processData() {
  console.log("Processing the fetched data...");
}

// Call fetchData, passing processData as the callback
fetchData(processData);
```

#### Explanation:
- **What**: `fetchData` is a function that simulates data fetching and accepts a callback.
- **How**: `fetchData` logs a message, simulates a delay, and calls `callback()` to process the data.
- **Where**: This is common in web development, where fetching data asynchronously is a frequent task.
