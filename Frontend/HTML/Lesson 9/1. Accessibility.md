2. **Key Practices for Accessibility**:

| Practice                        | Description                                                  | Icon  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Use Semantic HTML**           | Use HTML elements according to their intended purpose (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`). | üè∑Ô∏è    |
| **Alt Text for Images**         | Provide descriptive alt text for images using the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag. | üñºÔ∏è    |
| **Keyboard Navigation**         | Ensure all interactive elements are navigable using a keyboard (e.g., forms, links, buttons). | ‚å®Ô∏è    |
| **Label Elements**              | Use `<label>` tags for form inputs to improve screen reader accessibility. | üè∑Ô∏è    |
| **ARIA Roles**                  | Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties to enhance accessibility of dynamic content. | üåê    |
| **Contrast Ratio**              | Maintain a high contrast ratio between text and background to aid readability. | üé®    |
| **Headings Structure**          | Use heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) in a logical order to create a clear content hierarchy. | üìë    |
| **Focus Indicators**            | Ensure that focus indicators are visible when navigating via keyboard (e.g., outline on focused buttons). | üîç    |
| **Skip Links**                  | Provide "skip to content" links for easy navigation to the main content, bypassing repetitive elements. | üöÄ    |
