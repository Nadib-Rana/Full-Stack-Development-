### Semantic HTML 🌐

Semantic HTML uses HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. This improves accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and the overall structure of the web page.

1. **What is Semantic HTML?**
   - Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the content they enclose. Instead of using generic tags (like `<div>` and `<span>`), semantic tags describe the role of the content.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <header>...</header>
     <nav>...</nav>
     <main>...</main>
     <footer>...</footer>
     ```

2. **Common Semantic Elements**:

| Element          | Description                                            | Icon  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `<header>`       | Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links. | 🏷️    |
| `<nav>`          | Contains navigation links to other parts of the site. | 📚    |
