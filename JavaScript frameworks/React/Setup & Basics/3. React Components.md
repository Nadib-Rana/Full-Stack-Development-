### **React Components**

#### **Goal**:
Understand how to create and use components to organize and reuse UI elements in your React application.

#### **Types of Components**:
React offers two main types of components: **Function Components** and **Class Components**.

---

#### **1. Function Components**:
   - **Definition**: Function components are the simplest form of React components. They are JavaScript functions that return JSX.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```javascript
     function Greeting() {
       return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
     }
     ```
   - **Usage**: Function components are lightweight and preferred in modern React, especially with the introduction of **Hooks** (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) that bring additional features like state management and lifecycle methods to function components.
   - **Example in `App.js`**:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
       return (
         <div>
           <Greeting />
         </div>
       );
     }
     
     function Greeting() {
       return <h1>Welcome to My React App!</h1>;
     }
     ```
   - Here, `Greeting` is a function component that you can reuse anywhere within `App`.

#### **2. Class Components**:
   - **Definition**: Class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`, with a `render()` method that returns JSX.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```javascript
     import React, { Component } from 'react';
     
     class Greeting extends Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Usage**: Class components were traditionally used when you needed **state** or **lifecycle methods**. However, since the introduction of Hooks, function components can handle these features as well, making class components less common in modern React.
   - **Example in `App.js`**:
     ```javascript
     import React, { Component } from 'react';

     class App extends Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <Greeting />
           </div>
         );
       }
     }

     class Greeting extends Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>Welcome to My React App!</h1>;
       }
     }
     
     export default App;
     ```

### **Connecting to Props & State**

   - **Props**: Short for “properties,” props are used to pass data from one component to another, making them reusable and customizable.
     - Example:
       ```javascript
       function Greeting(props) {
         return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
       }

       function App() {
         return <Greeting name="Nadib" />;
       }
       ```
       - Here, `name` is a prop passed from `App` to `Greeting`.

   - **State**: State is a built-in React object used to manage data within a component. Unlike props, state is managed within the component and can change over time, triggering re-renders.
     - Example (Function Component with `useState` Hook):
       ```javascript
       import React, { useState } from 'react';

       function Counter() {
         const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

         return (
           <div>
             <p>Count: {count}</p>
             <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
           </div>
         );
       }
       ```
