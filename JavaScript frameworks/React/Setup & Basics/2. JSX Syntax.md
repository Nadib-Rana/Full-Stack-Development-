### **JSX Syntax**

#### **Goal**: 
Master JSX syntax to define the UI in a React application, blending HTML structure with JavaScript logic.

#### **What is JSX?**
- **JavaScript XML (JSX)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that React uses to describe the UI in a format that resembles HTML.
- It allows you to write elements and components in a way that’s closer to HTML, but it’s processed as JavaScript under the hood.

#### **JSX Basics**
- **Embedding Expressions**: Use `{}` to embed any JavaScript expression directly within JSX. This lets you add dynamic content to your UI.
   ```javascript
   const name = "React";
   return <h1>Welcome to {name}!</h1>;  // Output: Welcome to React!
   ```
- **Attributes**: JSX attributes look similar to HTML but with camelCase naming, like `className` instead of `class`:
   ```javascript
   <button className="primary-btn">Click Me</button>
   ```
- **Self-Closing Tags**: Just like in HTML, you can use self-closing tags for elements that don’t have children:
   ```javascript
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" />
   ```

#### **Integrating JavaScript with JSX**
- You can perform operations, call functions, or use variables directly inside JSX by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`.
   ```javascript
   const isLoggedIn = true;
   return <p>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please sign in."}</p>;
   ```
- **Event Handling**: Attach JavaScript functions to events like `onClick` in a similar way to handling events in JavaScript:
   ```javascript
   function handleClick() {
     alert("Button clicked!");
   }
   return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
   ```

#### **Practical Exercise with JSX in `App.js`**
   - Try experimenting with dynamic rendering in `App.js`:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
       const username = "Nadib";
       const loggedIn = true;
       
       return (
         <div>
           <h1>Welcome, {loggedIn ? username : "Guest"}!</h1>
           <p>{loggedIn ? "Enjoy your stay." : "Please log in to continue."}</p>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```
   - Save and preview in the browser. Notice how JSX responds to JavaScript values and conditions dynamically.

### **Connecting to Components**

Once you understand JSX, you’re ready to move to **Components**—the core building blocks in React that allow you to organize UI code into reusable pieces. Since JSX represents the structure within components, this transition is natural and essential in building scalable React applications.
